# Scripts
This folder contains a large number of different markdown files. In this ReadMe, we will describe the content of each script.

## noisy_channel_sims.Rmd

In this markdown we demonstrate how a variety of different manipulations affect the simulations. For example, we manipulate nu, p_noise, prior_noise, frequency, p_theta, etc.

This script containts the most breadth, but does not go into very much detail.

## more_noisy_channel_sims.Rmd

In this script we go into more detail, demonstrating the robust effects of gen_pref (i.e., prior_mu) and effects of p_noise manipulations.

## speaker_vs_listener_noise.Rmd

Here we focus on how the relationship between speaker noise (prior_noise) and listener noise (p_noise) affects regularization rates.

## corpus_modeling.Rmd

Finally, we compare our simulation results to those of the corpus of binomials which includes frequency and gen_pref information.

More details on all of these can be found in the paper that we'll be publishing soon.
