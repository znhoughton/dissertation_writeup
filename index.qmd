First and foremost, I would not be here if it weren’t for my advisor, Dr. Emily Morgan. Emily has been a never-ending source of knowledge and a constant source of reassurance. Emily was charged with the non-trivial task of helping to translate my incoherent stream of thoughts into a coherent set of ideas. She pushed me hard, believed in me, and never let me fall behind. I'm extraordinarily fortunate to have had her as my advisor.

I’d also like to thank many of the other professors here who have been crucial to my development as a linguist. Specifically, I’d like to thank Dr. Fernanda Ferreira whose knowledge of the field is so expansive that she can, without delay, provide a reference for any psycholinguistic phenomenon one can think of. I'd also like Dr. Kenji Sagae for his help over the years regarding all things natural language processing. Additionally, I'd like to thank Dr. Santiago Barreda who has provided a great deal of advice and help with statistical analyses. Finally, I'd like to thank Dr. Masoud Jasbi who has taught me the importance of various linguistics theories, even those I don't agree with.

Many of the ideas presented here have benefited in some form or another from feedback from many brilliant graduate students. I would especially like to thank Dingyi (Penny) Pan and Casey Felton for their feedback on much of the work included here.

I’d also like to thank Casey, Felix, and Nora for being a strong support system during my time here. Our Sunday shenanigans were a welcomed escape from the tireless work of completing a PhD.

My journey in linguistics started at the University of Oregon, and I want to thank all of the professors that supported the beginning of my journey. I particularly want to acknowledge Dr. Vsevolod Kapatsinski. Volya has donated countless hours of his time to me even after his role as my undergraduate thesis advisor was long over. He continues to be an endless source of knowledge and inspiration and much of my knowledge and interest in language learning comes from him. Perhaps more importantly, however, he is a constant reminder that linguistics is *fun*! Had it not been for our meetings over the years that devolved into ridiculous linguistic tangents, I would have burnt out long ago.

I would also like to thank 김선생님 who encouraged me to apply for graduate school in the first place and believed in me often times more than I believed in myself.

In addition, I want to thank Dr. Melissa Baese-Berk and Dr. Misaki Kato, and Dr. Zara Harmon. A great deal of my success as a graduate student came from their mentorship.

Along with the technical and academic guidance, it also would have been impossible to complete this PhD without the unending support I received from so many people in my personal life.

Specifically, I have been fortunate to have a strong support system in the form of of my two sisters, Kayla and Lily. We’ve been through so much together. I don’t know where I would be, not just academically, but more generally in life, had you two not been by my side.

This work would also have not been completed without the influence of my parents. Specifically, I want to thank my mom for teaching me that the ability to find the answer is far more important than knowing the answer, and my dad, for teaching me the discipline and practical skills to achieve my goals.

For both my undergraduate and graduate studies, I made the difficult decision to pursue my education on the opposite side of the country from my hometown in Connecticut. Despite the physical distance, I have always been able to count on my friends—not only during the easier times, but, more importantly, through the more challenging ones. Addy, Charles, Paul, Spencer, Wyatt, and 보미: thank you for being such a strong and constant support network.

Finally, to all the people I met during these five years at UC Davis: you welcomed me and gave me a home. You supported me, believed in me, and pushed me to be the best version of myself. I'm exceptionally proud to be an Aggie.

The number of people who have been indispensable in me getting here is undoubtedly larger than is feasible to include here. To those that I have inevitably left out, I apologize.
